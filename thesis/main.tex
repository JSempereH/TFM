\textbf{Abstract:}\\
\textit{
This document introduces key topics related to Privacy Enhancing Machine Learning (PEML) and Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs).
The explained algorithms are applicable to specific use cases where data cannot or should not be shared freely. In particular, Federated Learning will be studied with a horizontal partition of data, examining the impact of statistical heterogeneity on model performance using a custom implementation of the algorithms. Additionally, the paper will explore how to train models on vertically partitioned data and techniques for performing data analysis without revealing the original information, through differential privacy and generative models. Each chapter will present the mathematical definition of the problem, analyze the results of the implementation, and discuss some limitations or considerations associated with each technique.\\

This work has been made possible thanks to the warm welcome I received at GMV, where I was allowed to study scientific articles from the beginning and was supported in my training. In particular, I want to thank my professional tutor Juan Miguel Auñón García and my colleague Daniel Hurtado Ramírez for the help they have provided me. I also want to thank my academic tutor Carlos Gregorio Rodríguez for his guidance during the course of this work. And especially, I want to thank my boyfriend Miguel, who has put up with me while balancing the master’s studies, the work at GMV, and the writing of this document.
